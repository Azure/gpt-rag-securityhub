# Enterprise RAG Security Hub

This Security Hub is part of the **Enterprise RAG (GPT-RAG)** Solution Accelerator.

To learn more about the Enterprise RAG, please go to [https://aka.ms/gpt-rag](https://aka.ms/gpt-rag).

### Cloud Deployment

To deploy the Security Hub in the cloud for the first time, please follow the deployment instructions provided in the [Enterprise RAG repo](https://github.com/Azure/GPT-RAG?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).  
   
These instructions include the necessary infrastructure templates to provision the solution in the cloud.  
   
Once the infrastructure is provisioned, you can redeploy just the orchestrator component using the instructions below:

First, please confirm that you have met the prerequisites:

 - Azure Developer CLI: [Download azd for Windows](https://azdrelease.azureedge.net/azd/standalone/release/1.5.0/azd-windows-amd64.msi), [Other OS's](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd).
 - Git: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
 - Python 3.10: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31011/)

Then just clone this repository and reproduce the following commands within the gpt-rag-orchestrator directory:  

```
azd auth login  
azd env refresh  
azd deploy  
```

> Note: when running the ```azd env refresh```, use the same environment name, subscription, and region used in the initial provisioning of the infrastructure.
